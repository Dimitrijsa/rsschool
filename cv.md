## Dreams and Goals
I've always been interested in programming and web app creation, and I enjoy discovering new possibilities that programming languages provide. In the future I'd like to work for a web-developing company or create an independent business.

## Education and job experience
Currently I'm a 5th year student studying to become an engineer, and also work as a technician-technologist at a vehicle-building plant.

### Skills 
As for coding, I've been studying **HTML** **CSS** and a little bit of **JS** mostly by online tutorials from *ITVDN*, *TravesyMedia*, *DesignCourse* and *Online Tutorials*... So I perfectly mastered the ```Hello World!``` phrase :sparkles: .

## English language abilities    
I have mostly been studying English on my own, but I also took a course in LinguaLeo learning app. So I can read in English, watch movies and videos with no problem, also I use English to communicate with foreign colleagues at my present job.
